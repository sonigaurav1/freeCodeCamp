  /* 
✅Use the class keyword to create a Thermostat 
  class. The constructor accepts a Fahrenheit 
  temperature.

🔄In the class, create a getter to obtain the 
temperature in Celsius and a setter that accepts 
a temperature in Celsius.

✅Remember that C = 5/9 * (F - 32) and 
F = C * 9.0 / 5 + 32, where F is the value of 
temperature in Fahrenheit, and C is the value of 
the same temperature in Celsius.

🔄Note: When you implement this, you will track the 
temperature inside the class in one scale, either 
Fahrenheit or Celsius.

🔄This is the power of a getter and a setter. You 
are creating an API for another user, who can get 
the correct result regardless of which one you 
track.

In other words, you are abstracting implementation
 details from the user. */
