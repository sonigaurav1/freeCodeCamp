/* Yes, the onclick event is just one of many events that can be used in JavaScript. JavaScript provides a wide range of events that can be used to respond to different user actions or interactions with elements on a webpage. Here are some examples of commonly used events apart from the "click" event:

    onmouseover and onmouseout: These events are triggered when the mouse pointer enters or leaves an element, respectively. They are often used to create interactive hover effects.

    onkeydown, onkeypress, and onkeyup: These events are triggered when a keyboard key is pressed, held down, or released, respectively. They are commonly used to capture user input from keyboards.

    onsubmit: This event is triggered when a form is submitted, typically by clicking a submit button. It allows you to perform validation or handle form data before it is sent to the server.

    onload and onunload: The onload event is triggered when a webpage or an image finishes loading, while the onunload event is triggered when the user navigates away from the page. These events are often used for initialization or cleanup tasks.

    onchange: This event is triggered when the value of an input field, select box, or checkbox changes. It is commonly used to detect and respond to user selections or input changes.

    onfocus and onblur: The onfocus event is triggered when an element receives focus, such as when a user clicks inside an input field. The onblur event is triggered when the element loses focus, such as when the user clicks outside the input field.
